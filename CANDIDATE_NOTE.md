# Candidate note - What's next

I probably spent a little too much time refactoring in the first place.
I thought it was important to configure the linter and prettier, and to migrate the project to typescript to speed things up later.

There's still a lot of work to be done on this project to get it clean of course, but I've tried to structure it without making it too unwieldy as it is a pretty simple project for now.

Still a lot of work to be done to refactor but most notably, I was fixing the last few tests that do not pass anymore after my last changes.

I could not neither relocate the behaviours in game controller in the game service.

Types and structure is still messy but that still better than initial JS.

Would be glad to discuss about this exercice with you and give you more details on how I processed.

Thank you for your time and happy reading <3
